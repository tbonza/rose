% 3. Header (and Footer)
\pagestyle{fancy} % With this command we can customize the header style.
\fancyhf{} % This makes sure we do not have other information in our header or footer.
\lhead{\footnotesize  CS 7180}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size.
%\rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
\rhead{\footnotesize Assignment 1} %<---- Fill in your lastnames.
% Similar commands work for the footer (\lfoot, \cfoot and \rfoot).
% We want to put our page number in the center.
\cfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} 

\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty} % This command disables the header on the first page. 

\begin{tabular}{p{15.5cm}} % This is a simple tabular environment to align your text nicely 
{\large \bf CS 7180 Special Topics in AI: Deep Learning} \\

\hline % \hline produces horizontal lines.
\end{tabular} % Our tabular environment ends here.

\vspace*{0.3cm} % Now we want to add some vertical space in between the line and our title.

\begin{center} % Everything within the center environment is centered.

\section{Problem 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item report model accuracy in a table
  \begin{itemize}
  \item include test accuracy given 10 dropout probabilities (train for
    1 epoch, and report the final accuracies for each)
  \item final test accuracy when your model is trained for 10 epochs
    \end{itemize}
\item Discuss what you found to be the most effective strategies for
  designing a CNN
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Which regularization method was most effective (dropout,
    layerwise regularization, batch norm)?
  \item Do you see any problems with validating our hyperparams after
    training for one epoch? If so, why?
  \item Maybe cite some papers using your CNN architecture
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
